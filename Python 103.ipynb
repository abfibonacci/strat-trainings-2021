In a numeric for loop, the loop will set a temporary variable \"i\" (or whatever name you give it, doesn't really matter) equal to the start number, and then depending on the code you write inside the loop, use it to count something or access the indexes of a list. This temporary integer is automatically increased by 1 once the code inside the loop has finished running, and then the code runs **AGAIN**. This process repeats until the temporary integer \"i\" reaches **ONE LESS** than the end number. \n",

    "Furthermore, you can also use a step variable to indiciate how much to \"count by\". Traditionally, Python will count by 1's...1, 2, 3, so on. However, if we set step to say, 10, Python will start at the start number and keep adding ten until it reaches the greatest possible number (hypothetically, one less than the end number). You can also have a negative step to go backwards, but of course, you would have to make the start number greater than the end; in this case, the loop stop at **ONE GREATER** than the end number. Most of the times, we won't use this step parameter at all, but it does have its uses. \n",
